# About Me

Hi, My name is Quincy Tejada, I’m an **Electrical Engineer at Ivy Biomedical Systems** and a **2025 UConn graduate**.  
This site is my central hub: a place to **organize what I learn**, **showcase the projects I build**, and **share lessons** so others can learn from them too.

## What you’ll find here
- **Project Demonstrations:** Firmware and Hardware builds, PCB photos, fab files, and code.
- **Encyclopedia:** my running notes on electronics, embedded software, and PCB layout. What worked, what didn’t, and why.

## Current focus
I’m sharpening my **circuit design** and **PCB layout** skills—getting faster, cleaner, and more reliable with every revision.
